Simply playing with web services, comparing response times, and storing the
data retrieved to improve performance using a MySQL database and a local JSON
file.

I would highlight the use of ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, which I had never heard
before but seems to be pretty useful in cases like this.

It is also interesting that the data is displayed using the same code,
independendtly from its source: SOAP/XML, JSON or a database.
